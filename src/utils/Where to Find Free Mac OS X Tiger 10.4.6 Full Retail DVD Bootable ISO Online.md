Click on the "Download Options" menu on the right side of the page, and select "ISO IMAGE". The download will start automatically.
 
## Step 2: Burn the iso image to a DVD or a USB drive
 
Once you have downloaded the iso image, you need to burn it to a DVD or a USB drive that you can use to boot your Mac from. Depending on your Mac model and preference, you can choose either option.
 
### Burn the iso image to a DVD
 
If your Mac has a built-in or external optical drive that can write DVDs, you can use it to burn the iso image to a blank DVD-R disc. You can use any disc burning software that supports iso images, such as Disk Utility (for Mac), ImgBurn (for Windows), or Brasero (for Linux).
 
Here are the general steps for burning the iso image to a DVD:

1. Insert a blank DVD-R disc into your optical drive.
2. Launch your disc burning software and select the option to burn an iso image.
3. Browse and select the downloaded iso image file.
4. Choose a low burning speed (e.g., 4x) to avoid errors.
5. Start the burning process and wait until it finishes.
6. Eject the DVD disc from your optical drive.

### Burn the iso image to a USB drive
 
If your Mac does not have an optical drive, or if you prefer a faster and more portable option, you can use a USB drive to burn the iso image. You will need a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage space, and a software that can create bootable USB drives from iso images, such as TransMac (for Windows), Etcher (for Mac), or UNetbootin (for Linux).
